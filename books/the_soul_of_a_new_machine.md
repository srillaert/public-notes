Tracy Kidder was as a writer embedded in the team that developed the Eagle computer at Data General.
Data General was a competitor of DEC in the minicomputer market and 'Eagle' was the code name for Data General's response to DEC's introduction of the first VAX model at the end of 1977 and the 32-bit successor of Data General's own 16-bit Eclipse series.
When it was released to the market it was named the Eclipse MV/8000.  
The book describes mostly Tom West, the leader of the team, and his subordinates but lacks in historical and technical context.
The few interesting technical parts are the description of the processors' microcode written by the 'microkids' and the debugging of the processor and the cache with test programs and logic analyzers.
The book won the Pulitzer price for general non-fiction but has not aged well.
It is not as good as, for example, 'Hackers' by Steven Levy.
