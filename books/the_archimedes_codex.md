Tells the story by two of the main actors of the imaging and reconstruction of the text and diagrams of the Archimedes Palimpsest. The unsung hero of the book is Johan Heiberg, a Danish philogogist, who had already managed to recover a good deal of the text of Archimedes when he had access to the palimpsest in Constantinople in 1906. After 1906, during the 20th century, the state of the manuscript deterioted a lot, with mold on the pages because of bad storage and four pages being overpainted with a forgery.

Reviel Netz claims that Archimedes
- discovered calculus (uncontested)
- calculated with actual infinities in the Method (contested ?)
- founded combinatorics in Stomachion (contested ?)
