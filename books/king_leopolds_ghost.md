Hochschild's book relies extensively on the work of Belgian historian Jules Marchal. It explores Henry Morton Stanley's role in the Congo's exploration and delves into the period when the Congo was the personal possession of King Leopold II. The book also highlights the efforts of two of Leopold's most prominent critics, Edmond Morel and Roger Casement.
