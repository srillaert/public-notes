# Just for Fun
The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary

The only interesting parts were about Linus' his youth and years at the university in Helsinki.
These chapters also tell about his motivation to create Linux as a replacement for Minix.

Almost nothing is said about how he ran the Linux project when it became bigger.
The conversational style between the two co-authors and David Diamond telling about their relationship is superfluous.

Not a book worth rereading.
