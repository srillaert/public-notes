Personal history of the development of 'Chinook', the strongest checker playing computer program in the 90's, and (in this revised edition of the book) the solving of checkers in 2007.
Schaeffer is not afraid to write about the negative traits of the persons involved in the story, this brings the characters to life.  
Ken Thompson appears appears several times in the book. He and Schaeffer are friends and Thompson created 'Belle', the first computer program with an endgame database which inspired the endgame database of Chinook.  
Schaeffer is very critical about 'Blondie24', the checkers playing program of David Fogel. Blondie24 learned its evaluation function through evolution of a neural network. Blondie24 was only able to (occasionally) defeat Chinook on the lowest difficulty level (searching only 5-ply deep) and Schaeffer has concerns about the experimental methodology used by Fogel. See pages 448 til 450 of 'One Jump Ahead'.
