Reading 'The dream machine' was a pleasant surprise, it is much more than a biography of Licklider, it is a history of the genesis of personal computing and networking.
The former is also the topic of 'Hackers' and the latter of 'Where wizards stay up late' but these books cover specific groups and periods while 'The dream machine' covers a wider history.  
Without a doubt one of the best computer history books.
