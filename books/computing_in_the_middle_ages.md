A personal account of the almost 30 year career of the author, Severo Ornstein.
He had a quite remarkable career, working on several projects that were foundational for making the computer personal : 
- SAGE at MIT Lincoln Laboratory
- MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2
- LINC
- BBN IMPs for the first Arpanet
- Xerox PARC

The author started his career in software development and later on moved more and more into hardware design.
The book contains many personal anecdotes and is light on technical details.
The story told here is a nice addition to Mitchell Waldrop's "The Dream Machine", which was published one year before, in 2001.
