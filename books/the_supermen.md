"The supermen" tells the story of Seymour Crays' career and the companies he was involved in :
- Engineering Research Associates (ERA)
- Control Data Corporation (CDC)
- Cray Research
- Cray Computer Corporation

The best days of the vector processor supercomputers were the 70s and the 80s. Supercomputers were the Ferrari's of the computer world : hand-made in small quantities, a status symbol for the owners and very expensive (millions of dollars). After the end of the cold war, the money of the military research labs dried up and supercomputers also changed from vector processing to massive parallel processing.

A disappointment is that the book doesn't go deep into technical details, like how the vector processors worked or how they were programmed. The story is very much around the people working with Cray. This would have been OK except that these supercomputers are now like a side note in the history of computers. Very much talked about in their days because of their speed but only used in the specialized field of running computational simulations. Their influence on the development of other computers is small, in a way these vector processors were superseded by massive parallel versions of smaller computers.
