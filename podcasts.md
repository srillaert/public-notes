# My Camino - the podcast - Sean Dietrich | The pure magic of the camino

Sean Dietrich, known as Sean of the South, is an American columnist.

While walking the Camino, Sean held and fingered a rosary he had received from a nun only weeks before. A young Colombian pilgrim noticed and asked if they might pray it together. Side by side, they recited the Lordâ€™s Prayer again and again in Spanish, each holding a rosary in hand.

He carried his fiddle on the Camino, pausing to play tunes like 'Amazing Grace'.
