# Public notes

Repository with notes that I push to github.

Options to preview the markdown files while editing :
- The chrome extension [MarkDown Preview Plus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl). Launch from the shell through `google-chrome README.md`.
- The Visual Studio Code extension [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced).
- *grip*. *grip* launches a local server that can be accessed from any browser. Note that grip does *not* support offline viewing.
