Rego da Manga, 56, Herbón, 15915, A Coruña, Spain  
A Franciscan monastery, now converted into an albergue, is run by dedicated Spanish volunteers (AGACS, Asociación Galega de Amigos do Camiño de Santiago). There is a guided tour, a pilgrims' mass, and a communal dinner, creating a spiritual experience.
+ Guided tour: The first part, inside the church, was a bit dull as the Spanish-speaking guide used a mobile phone for English translation, which made it hard to stay engaged. However, the second part, a tour around the monastery where various guests helped translate, was much more engaging. The guide's inspirational speech at the end was especially memorable.
+ Mass conducted by three elderly priests, concluding with a special pilgrims' blessing where guests read a text in their native languages.
+ Communal dinner: I sat with a Christian youth group from Aveiro, Portugal. Fun fact: Aveiro is known as the "Venice of Portugal" and is famous for its salt flats.
