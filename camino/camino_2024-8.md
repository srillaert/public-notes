- Began the walk with a slight detour off the Camino in Ponte de Lima to pick up a baguette at Panilima Arcozelo.
- Not far outside Ponte de Lima, I came across Stefan, a German pilgrim, who was bleeding from his leg. It seems he had fallen when leaning against an unstable stone wall beside the trail. His leg was covered with scars, and he had a deep cut. A German woman with some first aid experience helped disinfect the wound and applied a bandage. Just a few hundred meters ahead, we were lucky to find a bar where Stefan could rest. When I saw him later in Tui, he told me he had needed stitches after seeking professional medical care.

- Crossed the bridge from Valença, Portugal, into Tui, Spain.
- Stopped for coffee at the Irish bar, The White Clover, where I unexpectedly ran into Stefan, the German pilgrim who had injured his leg just after Ponte de Lima.
- Stefan recommended the albergue Convento Del Camino, which turned out to be an excellent choice.
- In the courtyard of the albergue, I met an older Danish pilgrim named Jens, who offered to share a bottle of wine. We chatted about his life, and I shared stories about my dad, which moved me to tears.
- Attended the medieval festival at the fortifications of Valença and had a fantastic evening enjoying local pancakes and sangria with a group of German friends.

- Upon arriving at the 'Albergue de Peregrinos de Briallos' just before 7 PM, I realized I was at the wrong albergue. My reservation was at 'Albergue da Portela - Barro,' where the communal dinner begins at 7 PM. Unfortunately, I had passed that albergue by 6 kilometers.

### 2024-8-31 Convento de Herbón
Rego da Manga, 56, Herbón, 15915, A Coruña, Spain  
A Franciscan monastery, now converted into an albergue, is run by dedicated Spanish volunteers (AGACS, Asociación Galega de Amigos do Camiño de Santiago). There is a guided tour, a pilgrims' mass, and a communal dinner, creating a spiritual experience.
+ Guided tour: The first part, inside the church, was a bit dull as the Spanish-speaking guide used a mobile phone for English translation, which made it hard to stay engaged. However, the second part, a tour around the monastery where various guests helped translate, was much more engaging. The guide's inspirational speech at the end was especially memorable.
+ Mass conducted by three elderly priests, concluding with a special pilgrims' blessing where guests read a text in their native languages.
+ Communal dinner: I sat with a Christian youth group from Aveiro, Portugal. Fun fact: Aveiro is known as the "Venice of Portugal" and is famous for its salt flats.
+ Communal breakfast. 
+ Sleeping arrangement: A long corridor with alcoves, each containing a bunk bed.
