# The Wicklow Way 2007-7-13 till 2007-7-19

I had planned for Hanne and me to hike the entire Irish Coast to Coast Walk, but due to the nearly constant rain, we only managed the first stage -The Wicklow Way- before returning to Dublin.

During our walk, we used **The Irish Coast‑to‑Coast Walk** by Paddy Dillon (Cicerone Press, 2005).

The dates listed below refer to the departure from the accommodation, not the arrival.
