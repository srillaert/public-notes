## Camino Portugués Coastal, Spain

### 2024-10-14 Vigo - Precioso apartment

An apartment conveniently located near the bus station and Santiago de Vigo church.
+ Close to the bus station and the starting point of our Camino, the Santiago de Vigo church.

+ Three bedrooms, each with a double bed.
- The electricity plug came out when unplugging the coffee maker. It caused a bit of a panic, but after several tries, it could be plugged back in.
- Only one bathroom with both the toilet and the shower. For a group of six, it would be useful to have an extra bathroom.

Ideal for a family of 6 on the Camino, this apartment has two bathrooms, three bedrooms, and is situated in a quiet area.

### 2024-10-16 Pontevedra - Albergue Virxe Peregrina
Rúa de Ramón Otero Pedraio, s/n, 36004 Pontevedra, Spain  
Good common areas but the crowded dormitory gets too hot during the night.

### 2024-10-17 Briallos - Albergue de Peregrinos de Briallos
EP-8102, 25, 8102, 36658 O Cruceiro, Pontevedra, Spain  
The best albergue on this camino.
+ The pilgrim’s menu is now only €12. The meat stew is the best choice for the main dish, as the alternative—chicken with rice—is simply that: a piece of chicken with rice and no sauce. For an appetizer, the vegetable soup is recommended.
+ A washing machine and dryer are available for just a few euros.
+ The kitchen is spacious with several tables and a fridge, which is impressive for such a small albergue.
+ The boys enjoyed playing on the basketball court, though they didn’t use the small playground.
+ We only had one other person in our room.
- No shops nearby.

### 2024-10-18 Pontecesures - Albergue de peregrinos de Pontecesures
Carr. Escuelas, 8, 36640 Pontecesures, Pontevedra, Spain  
Pontecesures is an industrial town, but the albergue has good common areas and is lightly occupied.
+ Only a few other (female) pilgrims were here during our stay, as most seem to continue on to Padrón.
+ Friendly hospitalera who speaks German and Spanish, though only limited English.
+ Books and maps are available at the entrance; I was even able to take an older Camino book for free.
+ Kitchen and several dining tables are provided.
+ Conveniently located near the town center, which has a church and a few pubs.
- Room lighting cannot be controlled. At around 5 AM, it unexpectedly turned on in the dormitory before turning off again just as suddenly.
- Pontecesures is an industrial town, with a large factory visible from a distance.

### 2024-10-19 Teo - Albergue de Peregrinos de Teo
Vilares de Calo, s/n, 15866 Rúa de Francos, A Coruña, Spain  
Likely the last municipal albergue before Santiago, which makes it quite crowded.
+ Located in a green neighborhood with a stream running beside the albergue.
+ Friendly hospitalera, though she only speaks Spanish and took some time to register our family.
+ Last chance to stay for €10 before reaching Santiago.
- Likely due to this, it tends to be crowded and was nearly full during our stay.
- A couple of restaurants nearby but no budget-friendly "menu peregrino" available.
- Not enough tables for everyone to have breakfast in the morning.
- No shops nearby.

### 2024-10-20 Santiago de Compostela - Apartment of Maria Dolores

An apartment with 9 beds, located 1.5 km from the Cathedral, ideal for a group stay.
+ Three bedrooms: one with a double bed, one with three single beds, and another with four single beds, totaling 9 beds.
+ Well-equipped kitchen integrated with the living room in a spacious, open-plan area.
+ Despite being close to Santiago's ring road, the traffic noise was not noticeable.
- Located 1.5 km from the Cathedral, but it's an easy and enjoyable walk.
- Some water was present in the bathroom due to the dehumidifier.
- Accommodating 9 people could feel cramped, as there is only one bathroom and a single dining table.

+ Friendly reception available just across the street.
+ Two compact bathrooms.
