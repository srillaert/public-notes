# Camino 2024-10-12 till 2024-10-21

The dates listed below refer to the departure from the accommodation, not the arrival.

## Travelling and arrival in Porto

### 2024-10-12 Going to Porto

#### Day
- Had pizza at Jimmy and Dorte’s house.
- Jimmy drove us to the airport in our Citroën Grand Picasso.
- Took a Ryanair flight from Billund to Porto.
- A van, booked through Booking.com, brought us from the airport to our hostel, which turned out to be on a lively party street. :-(
- Enjoyed a complimentary port wine from the hostel before heading to bed.
- Didn’t sleep well due to the party noise outside.

### 2024-10-13 Porto - Invictus hostel
R. Das Oliveiras 73, 4050-449 Porto, Portugal  
A crowded hostel located in Porto's lively party district.
+ Friendly reception in the evening with a free glass of port.
+ Located in the city center.
- Located in the party district. On saturday nights, one hears music and people talking loudly till 3 AM.
- Only one toilet shared by a whole floor.
- Almost no common areas when the reception is closed between 11 PM and 10 AM.
- Kitchen is very small with only one table that seats 3 people for the whole hostel !
- Many hostel guests sleep in late so that one has to keep quiet and keep the lights off in the dormitory during the morning.

#### Day
- Picked up breakfast at a supermarket in Porto and ate it in the hostel's cramped kitchen. Next time I should be less stingy and try eating at a local bakery. ;-)
- Visited the cathedral of Porto and got our first stamp there.
- We tried to catch a bus to the football stadium, but it never arrived, so we took the metro instead. Buying the right tickets at the metro station was a bit tricky!
- The stadium tour was boring, with more focus on photo ops than actual commentary. The guides seemed disengaged, and due to time constraints with our bus to Vigo, we had to rush through the stadium museum. The museum was modern with lots of photos and trophies and as good as a football club museum gets. ;-)
- The bus ride from Porto to Vigo took about 3,5 hours, with stops at Porto airport and Braga.
- We arrived late in Vigo and picked up some groceries on our walk from the bus station to the apartment.

## Camino Portugués Coastal, Spain

### 2024-10-14 Vigo - Precioso apartment
Rúa do Ecuador 78, 36204 Vigo, Spain  
An apartment conveniently located near the bus station and Santiago de Vigo church.
+ Close to the bus station and the starting point of our Camino, the Santiago de Vigo church.
+ Coffee maker with cups of coffee.
+ Three bedrooms, each with a double bed.
- The electricity plug came out when unplugging the coffee maker. It caused a bit of a panic, but after several tries, it could be plugged back in.
- Only one bathroom with both the toilet and the shower. For a group of six, it would be useful to have an extra bathroom.

#### Walk
- We left the apartment in Vigo later than planned, catching up on sleep after the previous night in Porto.
- When we arrived at Santiago de Vigo Church, our intended starting point for the Camino, a mass was about to begin, so we couldn’t get our Vigo stamp there.
- Instead, we added a few extra kilometers by heading to the tourist office for our Vigo stamp. They also provided us with a map of Vigo, showing the route to the Camino.
- From the tourist office, we walked along the main shopping street until we reached the Camino.
- Just before spotting the first Camino arrows, we visited a modern church, where we lit a candle.
- Already on the Camino but still in Vigo, we stopped at a cozy pub for an extra stamp, drinks, and an ice cream treat for the boys.
- Along the way, we enjoyed scenic views of Vigo's fjord and its "bateas" — floating mussel farms.
- It took some time to clear the sprawling suburbs of Vigo, and the boys complained a bit about the long walk. This was the least pleasant part of our journey.
- Finally, we entered a lovely forested trail. We stopped by a table next to a small waterfall, where the boys had fun recording slow-motion videos.
- It was exciting to revisit the spot where I had been just two months earlier, where the coastal Camino merges with the central route in Redondela. Between Vigo and Redondela, we had encountered only a few pilgrims—but now, they were everywhere.
- We continued to the far side of Redondela to reach our accommodation with Maria Rosa.
- In the evening, we dined at "Turkish Döner Kebab" (Av. de Ernestina Otero, 55), and on the way back, we picked up some groceries.

### 2024-10-15 Redondela - Apartment of Maria Rosa
R. Blanco Amor 13, 36800 Redondela  
Ideal for a family of 6 on the Camino, this apartment has two bathrooms, three bedrooms, and is situated in a quiet area.
+ Maria Rosa gave us a tour of the apartment.
+ Three bedrooms, one of which had two single beds for the two oldest boys.
+ Two bathrooms, each equipped with a toilet and a shower.
+ Washing machine provided for our dirty clothes. There was no dryer, but a heater helped dry the clothes by morning.
+ Supermarket and kebab restaurant nearby.
+ Quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Redondela.
- The furniture is a bit old, but who cares.
- We had to wait about 10 minutes at the entrance before Maria Rosa and her husband arrived to let us into the apartment.

#### Walk
- Just before leaving Redondela, we got stamps at the Chapel of Saint Mariña.
- In Arcade, we stopped for soft drinks and coffee on the terrace of Casa Calvor. I had stayed there during my previous camino. The swimming pool in the back was now filled with greenish water and likely closed for the autumn and winter seasons. We also got stamps at the bar here. I warned a small group of older e-bikers that the hill after Arcade wouldn't be easy on bikes.
- Before crossing the medieval bridge of Ponte Sampaio, we picked up some food at a supermarket and ate it by Verdugo river with a view of the bridge. There was an information board about the 1809 battle fought nearby between the French and the Spanish during the Peninsular war.
- Ponte Sampaio has retained its authentic charm with hórreos and winding, narrow streets.
- After the village, the Camino ascends a hill. The rocky path here would be tough to manage with a bike.
- Upon reaching Pontevedra, we checked into the municipal albergue. The boys weren’t keen on dormitory accommodations after the rough experience in Porto.
- In the evening, we tried to dine at a traditional Galician restaurant, but it turned out to be closed, so we opted for a hamburger place instead.
- I didn’t sleep well that night due to the dormitory’s heat and the snorer below me. I even considered the sofa outside for some relief, but it was already occupied…

### 2024-10-16 Pontevedra - Albergue Virxe Peregrina
Rúa de Ramón Otero Pedraio, s/n, 36004 Pontevedra, Spain  
Good common areas but the crowded dormitory gets too hot during the night.
+ Large entrance with maps and friendly volunteer staff.
+ Large dining aread with lots of tables.
+ Kitchen with some cutlery and glasses.
+ Close to the trainstation and supermarket.
- A couple of kilometers before the beautiful historical city center of Pontevedra.
- Crowded dormitory with the usual snorers.
- Dormitory gets too hot during the night.

#### Walk
- We had breakfast in the albergue and chatted with a French woman from Bretagne who was heading home. She shared some tips about the albergues along the way.
- We had to rush out because we were the last to leave, and everyone is expected to depart by a certain time - we didn't know that. ;-)
- Despite the rain, we enjoyed a pleasant walk through Pontevedra. In the city center, we visited a church, and on the footbridge out, we ran into the woman from Israel again, who took some photos of us on the bridge.
- It took a while to get out of Pontevedra. Before we left, we bought rain covers for our backpacks and stopped at a supermarket where we could eat at a table.
- We passed the information board at the junction between the Spiritual Variant and the traditional camino route. I would have loved to take the Spiritual route after hearing great things about it, but we didn't have the time. The Spiritual route takes a bit longer due to the boat trip at the end. Because of the rain, we didn't linger at the board.
- Instead of taking the shortcut to go to the albergue of Briallos, we stayed on the Camino, which here follows paths parallel to a busy road.
- At the albergue, a group of young Germans were enjoying beers and pizza. They stayed in the other bedroom.
- In our room there was only an young Easter European woman who was unfortunate enough to share the room with our family ;-), not only in this albergue but also the coming days.
- While having the pilgrims' menu at the bar next to the albergue, a Danish family arrived. We ate and chatted together. Afterwards, they still had several kilometers to walk through the rain, as they had reserved accommodation just before Caldas de Reis. We felt sorry for them when it started pouring shortly after they left. We would meet them again the next day at the church in Caldas de Reis.
- That night, we slept well. The only disturbance was a bit of noise when the German group returned to their room.

### 2024-10-17 Briallos - Albergue de Peregrinos de Briallos
EP-8102, 25, 8102, 36658 O Cruceiro, Pontevedra, Spain  
The best albergue on this camino.
+ The pilgrim’s menu is now only €12. The meat stew is the best choice for the main dish, as the alternative—chicken with rice—is simply that: a piece of chicken with rice and no sauce. For an appetizer, the vegetable soup is recommended.
+ A washing machine and dryer are available for just a few euros.
+ The kitchen is spacious with several tables and a fridge, which is impressive for such a small albergue.
+ The boys enjoyed playing on the basketball court, though they didn’t use the small playground.
+ We only had one other person in our room.
- No shops nearby.

### 2024-10-18 Pontecesures - Albergue de peregrinos de Pontecesures
Carr. Escuelas, 8, 36640 Pontecesures, Pontevedra, Spain  
Pontecesures is an industrial town, but the albergue has good common areas and is lightly occupied.
+ Only a few other (female) pilgrims were here during our stay, as most seem to continue on to Padrón.
+ Friendly hospitalera who speaks German and Spanish, though only limited English.
+ Books and maps are available at the entrance; I was even able to take an older Camino book for free.
+ Kitchen and several dining tables are provided.
+ Conveniently located near the town center, which has a church and a few pubs.
- Room lighting cannot be controlled. At around 5 AM, it unexpectedly turned on in the dormitory before turning off again just as suddenly.
- Pontecesures is an industrial town, with a large factory visible from a distance.

### 2024-10-19 Teo - Albergue de Peregrinos de Teo
Vilares de Calo, s/n, 15866 Rúa de Francos, A Coruña, Spain  
Likely the last municipal albergue before Santiago, which makes it quite crowded.
+ Located in a green neighborhood with a stream running beside the albergue.
+ Friendly hospitalera, though she only speaks Spanish and took some time to register our family.
+ Last chance to stay for €10 before reaching Santiago.
- Likely due to this, it tends to be crowded and was nearly full during our stay.
- A couple of restaurants nearby but no budget-friendly "menu peregrino" available.
- Not enough tables for everyone to have breakfast in the morning.
- No shops nearby.

### 2024-10-20 Santiago de Compostela - Apartment of Maria Dolores
Av. de Rodríguez de Viguri, 4, portal 4, 15703 Santiago de Compostela, La Coruña, Spain  
An apartment with 9 beds, located 1.5 km from the Cathedral, ideal for a group stay.
+ Three bedrooms: one with a double bed, one with three single beds, and another with four single beds, totaling 9 beds.
+ Well-equipped kitchen integrated with the living room in a spacious, open-plan area.
+ Despite being close to Santiago's ring road, the traffic noise was not noticeable.
- Located 1.5 km from the Cathedral, but it's an easy and enjoyable walk.
- Some water was present in the bathroom due to the dehumidifier.
- Accommodating 9 people could feel cramped, as there is only one bathroom and a single dining table.

## Departure from Porto

### 2024-10-21 Porto - Loureiro Villas
Rua do Loureiro 47 - 49, União de Freguesias do Centro, 4000-328 Porto, Portugal  
An apartment located next to São Bento trainstation in the city center.
+ Located in the city center, right next to São Bento train station.
+ Friendly reception available just across the street.
+ Two compact bathrooms.
+ Private courtyard with a table, though it's enclosed by walls and feels somewhat uninviting.
- Minor maintenance issues, such as a broken handle for the shower head.
- Feels somewhat cramped, with only a small living room that includes a sofa bed.
