# St. Olav's Way 2005-7-2 till 2005-7-4

My goal was to reach the Nidaros Cathedral by June, 29th, St. Olav's Day, but during the three days that I spent walking the St. Olav's Way, I didn't encounter a single pilgrim. I came down with a mild case of food posioning, so after three days I decided to end the walk and return to Oslo to explore other hikes in Norway.

Used during this walk **The Pilgrim Road to Nidaros** by Alison Raju (Cicerone Press, 2001).
